In the fall of 2021, I joined the Gamma Zeta chapter of the Alpha Chi Sigma (AXS) professional chemistry fraternity here at Cal Poly. Since joining I have been able to tutor younger chemistry students in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. We take part in scientific outreach opportunities for the local community, we put on events for the general campus community as wall as the chemistry department.
