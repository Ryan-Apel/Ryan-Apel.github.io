### More Information

I am a Chemistry student at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California.

I work as a Student Researcher in the Costanzo Lab on campus. [CostanzoLab.com](https://costanzolab.com/)

I am passionate about Organic Chemistry and Polymers. I still have a lot to learn, but I am excited to explore more!

I love to make food and eat food. Cooking and baking are a great way to do a little chemistry at home. I love to work on new recepies and flavors, always trying to expand my palate.

I also like to get together with some buds to play Jazz. I am a Jazz Trumpet player and am always trying to learn more and imporve my skills. Currently working my way through every song in the Bb Real Book.
